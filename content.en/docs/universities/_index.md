## Scholarships

### Scholarships for the LGBTQA+ community

Many organizations will offer scholarships where the recipient is LGBTQA+, here we list a few programs.

- [Grad School Application Funding - ostem.org](https://www.ostem.org/page/grad-app-funding)
- [LGBT Scholarships Around the World - QS](https://www.topuniversities.com/student-info/scholarship-advice/lgbt-scholarships-around-world)
- [Scholarships & Financial Aid For LGBTQ Students - gograd.org](https://www.gograd.org/financial-aid/scholarships/lgbtq)

You can go on a broad search for keywords such as: 

```lgbt, queer, transgender, scholarship, [STEM, Science, Art, etc.]```

### College scholarships

Universities may offer certain scholarships to students before or after enrollment based on grades, performance, etc. For example, under the entry for the United States, one commenter noted that "even for a master's degree, there are enough scholarships to decrease the cost down to European standards."

You need to consult with the relevant department of the university for the details of scholarships in this section.

### Research-oriented scholarships

Some foundations invest money in advance to fund research in potential research areas, such as biosecurity, artificial intelligence security, environmental issues, etc.

Some examples of institutions.

## From the beginning to the application

The hardest step in choosing a college is actually finding the range of target colleges that match your current grades and the school you attend. Because we don't have the experience to tell us which range is the one we match.

But other than this step, we were able to get a fair amount of work done.

### Step 1: Pick a country range

This step is more subjective, and you can combine our country and region profiles to give yourself a general range. But this range is not necessarily dead, and it may even be much broader than the range you end up choosing, and that's all right; you can absolutely draw a little more range and thus increase the scope of your choice.

### Step 2: School List

First we need to prepare some tools, such as various school rankings,
[QS](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings) , 
[THE](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings) , 
[USNews](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/rankings) , 
[ARWU](https://www.shanghairanking.cn/rankings/arwu/2022) , 
[CWUR](https://cwur.org/) , 
etc. The rankings do not represent the actual level of the school, as different rankings have different focuses, some of which we may not care about, but this reference may also be valuable for us if we have no other sources of information. Also note that they tend to rank every year, so you may want to be careful to switch to the latest year.

It is also important to note that school rankings do not represent subject rankings, and their subject rankings are also a factor to consider. It is also possible to see through some of the subject ranking agencies, which are also not very accurate, but they are free and open data and have considerable reference value.

Among these rankings, you can make a list of the universities in your favorite country or countries, for example. The list contains, for example, all the countries you want to filter.

### Step 3: List of programs

Then, we have to find the majors/programs that you like in these schools.

Specifically, we have to search the name of the school in Google or other search engines and go to the official website. Find the admissions program or program description, and then find a list of all their undergraduate/master's programs. This way we can use a filter or search to find the program we are interested in.

At this point, you use a table to record all the details of the programs you find. For example, the language requirements, GPA requirements, credit requirements, etc. for this program. In addition often the program's page contains information on tuition and scholarships, which is also important to consider.

Thus, once we have sorted out all the schools' available programs, you can continue to prepare according to the program requirements if you are in the pre-bachelor or high school stage; if you are about to reach the application stage, you can also start to exclude programs that do not meet the requirements.

### Step 4: Formal Application

At this point, we probably don't have any special details to go over, as each school has different requirements, which means they may require different materials to be submitted and elaborated upon.

Good luck with your application.

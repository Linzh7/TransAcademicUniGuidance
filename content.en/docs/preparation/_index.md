# Preparation

In order to apply to a good college and go to your dream place, we need to do some prep, including but not limited to GPA, competition experience, project experience, essay publication, etc.

This section will describe the preparation that can be done for different majors.

## Integration into your university

## GPA

The calculation of GPA can vary greatly from school to school, so that you could choose the university that score above 90% to get the highest grade, not 100% to get the highest grade.

## Contests

There are naturally different competitions for different disciplines, but there are many competitions that many engineering or application-related disciplines can participate in.

## Research

Many labs at the university and departmental often provide a lot of resources, such as participating in professors' research projects.

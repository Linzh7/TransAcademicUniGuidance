# Computer Science and Technology

## Contests

### Algorithm competitions

Algorithm competitions require the design of algorithms to solve mathematically biased problems and receive time and language constraints.

### Program development competitions

Compared to algorithm competitions, program development competitions are a bit longer. It is also not too restrictive on the developer's technology stack, and the questions cover a wide range of aspects, so you can often find a topic that is relatively more suitable for you, and thus more flexible, but often less recognized than program development competitions.

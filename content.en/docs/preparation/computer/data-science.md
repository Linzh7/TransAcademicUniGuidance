# Data Science

With the development and application of artificial intelligence and data science, many companies such as Baidu and Huawei have also increased the number of competitions in this area and given generous prizes, etc.

## Learning

If your college already offers related courses, such as machine learning and so on, you can try out and try hands-on practice in advance. But please don't let the fact that many libraries have already implemented some of the functions prevent you from understanding the principles.

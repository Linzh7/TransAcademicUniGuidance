## Visa

The UK offers a work visa policy: if you graduate from a top 50 university in the world in your year of study, you will be eligible for a n-year work visa. So, if you graduated from a top 50 school in the world and you are not satisfied with a local career, you can take note of this information.


<!-- Non-commonwealth foreigners do not have 'right to abode', nor do they have a path towards 'right to abode'. 'Right to abode' is reserved for Commonwealth citizens only, non-Commonwealth immigrants only can possibly have 'leave to remain'. 

In modern English, it would be 'allowing/condoning someone to remain'. British immigration law are extremely complicated (as most E&W laws are). Even though in practicalities there wouldn't be significant discrepancies between 'right to abode' and 'leave to remain', sometimes it does matter, like if an immigrant committed a penal offense, if they're a Commonwealth citizen with right to abode they're not likely to be deported, but with a non-Commonwealth citizen with indefinite leave to remain, they could face deportation. -->

# The Netherlands

## General Overview

The rate of English proficiency is very high, along with relatively higher income and lower taxation. Moreover, there is a higher level of social equality, which is also more accommodating toward transgender individuals.

## Education

### Universities

The top universities in the Netherlands are generally ranked between 55-200 as of 2022.

There are primarily two types of universities: research universities ("universiteit") and universities of applied sciences ("hogeschool").

The application process in the Netherlands is very DIY-friendly. All application information for the University of Amsterdam, VU University Amsterdam, and the University of Groningen can be found easily on their official websites.

Generally speaking, the admission requirements are low, unless you are applying for highly selective disciplines like medicine. The University of Amsterdam has one of the world's best communication schools in the field of journalism. Leiden University houses one of Europeâ€™s most prestigious law schools; notable alumni include Hugo Grotius, one of the most famous jurists in human history.

The annual tuition fees are usually around 11-15k Euros. The cost of living varies depending on the region but is generally high; for example, the rent for a single room in Leiden, The Hague, and Amsterdam is about 950 - 1,400 Euros.

### High School Diploma

One of the most distinctive features of Dutch education is the "colloquium doctum" system, as detailed by the University of Groningen. Even if you have not completed prior education, you can take the colloquium doctum exam when you reach 21. If passed, you would be considered a high school graduate.

The colloquium doctum covers various subjects, conducted primarily in Dutch, and varies depending on the field you wish to enter. For a bachelor's degree in law, for example, you would need advanced history, French or German, Dutch, and English. The difficulty is approximately equivalent to translating a mainstream traditional newspaper article (for example, French's Le Monde, C1 reading, English equivalent would be "The Times").

## Employment

Employment opportunities in the Netherlands are abundant, and many international companies also establish branches there. Besides, there are many local Dutch companies, such as Booking.com.

For regulated professions like doctors and lawyers, proficiency in Dutch is required.

## Residency

A valid residence of five years is required. Naturalization and Dutch language exams are also necessary.

In emergency or special circumstances for transgender individuals desiring residence in the Netherlands, services accommodating transgender-friendly needs are available, along with a six-day preparation period for rest.

# United Kingdom

{{< hint warning >}}

**The UK government has blacklisted over 50 countries for 'making it too easy to change gender', requiring any individual who moves from these blacklisted countries to the UK to reapply for a gender change in the UK. The blacklist includes countries like New Zealand and Belgium that recognize gender based on 'self-declaration'. Please be aware of this condition when applying.** [^1]

## Visa

The UK offers a work visa policy: if you graduate from a top 50 university in the world in your year of study, you will be eligible for a n-year work visa. So, if you graduated from a top 50 school in the world and you are not satisfied with a local career, you can take note of this information.

States such as California, New Jersey, and Maine in the USA are also reportedly on the so-called 'blacklist' of the Conservative government. In the Republic of Ireland, self-identification has been a reality since the passage of the Gender Recognition Act (GRA) in 2015. This reform means that citizens from blacklisted counties who move to the UK will be forced to comply with the UK's complex rules, and their obtained Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC) may not be recognized in the country. They say: 'Now many countries are at odds with the UK, so this is to correct the balance and ensure that if someone has a Gender Recognition Certificate, they have gone through the same process as everyone else.”

# Europe

Attitudes toward LGBTQA+ vary widely across Europe, with Western and Northern Europe being more open overall, Central and Southern Europe moderate, and Eastern Europe worse.

## Friendliness Survey

[Rainbow Europe](https://www.rainbow-europe.org/) tracks the status of countries on different indicators each year to gauge how friendly each country is to the sexually diverse community. Please note, however, that there are cases where countries rank high overall but are not friendly to transgender groups. Thus, it is recommended to carefully identify from the table how trans-friendly the country's policies are.

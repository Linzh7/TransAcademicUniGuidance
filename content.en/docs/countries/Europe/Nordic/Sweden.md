# Sweden

## Study


### Costs



## Employment

Many companies often choose to locate in Sweden for their Nordic headquarters. As a result, Sweden has a wide range of employment resources, and it is relatively easy to find a variety of jobs with a high prevalence of English and a relatively low demand for Swedish.

## Residency

Swedish citizenship can be applied for after five years of continuous possession of a work visa, and no Swedish language exam is required. However, with the rise to power of the Conservative Party in recent years, there may be adjustments to immigration policy.

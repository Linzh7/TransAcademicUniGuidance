## Study


### Costs



## Employment

Many companies often choose to locate in Sweden for their Nordic headquarters. As a result, Sweden has a wide range of employment resources, and it is relatively easy to find a variety of jobs with a high prevalence of English and a relatively low demand for Swedish.

## Residency

For proof of property, Sweden requires in [Migrationsverket](https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/Studying-and-researching-in-Sweden/Higher -education/Residence-permit-for-higher-education.html) requires 113,400 SEK/year for applications after 2023, which can be reduced when the school provides housing or food.

Swedish citizenship can be applied for after five years of continuous possession of a work visa, and no Swedish language exam is required. However, with the rise to power of the Conservative Party in recent years, there may be adjustments to immigration policy.

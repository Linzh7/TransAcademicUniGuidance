# Sweden

## Transgender Health Resources

In 2022, Sweden prohibits the provision of any hormone and hormone blockers to humans under the age of 18 for non-research purposes. And access to gender-affirming treatment is subject to psychiatric evaluation and must be lived for one year **without any medical help** to identify with the same gender. [^1]

As of February 1, 2023, Sweden is the only one of the five Nordic countries that has not passed the gender self-identification act.

## Study


### Costs

According to the [Swedish Migration Agency]((https://www.migrationsverket.se/)), non-EU/EEA students must have at least SEK 8,568 (approximately 835 euros) per month to cover their living expenses. For the latest information, please refer to the [Studying in Sweden](https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/Studying-in-Sweden.html).

Therefore, the minimum annual living expenses would be SEK 102,816 (approximately 10,020 euros). You will need to provide proof of funds, such as a bank statement or similar documents. Please refer to the Swedish Migration Agency's website for specific requirements.

## Employment

Many companies often choose to locate in Sweden for their Nordic headquarters. As a result, Sweden has a wide range of employment resources, and it is relatively easy to find a variety of jobs with a high prevalence of English and a relatively low demand for Swedish.

If you hold a residence permit for higher education studies and have completed at least two semesters of university courses in Sweden, you may obtain a residence permit to search for a job or explore the possibility of starting your own company in Sweden.

## Residency

For proof of property, Sweden requires in [Migrationsverket](https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/Studying-and-researching-in-Sweden/Higher -education/Residence-permit-for-higher-education.html) requires 113,400 SEK/year (9,450 SEK/month) for applications after 2023, which can be reduced when the school provides housing or food.

Swedish citizenship can be applied for after five years of continuous possession of a work visa, and no Swedish language exam is required. However, with the rise to power of the Conservative Party in recent years, there may be adjustments to immigration policy.

# Finland

Finland is a country located in Northern Europe, with Helsinki as its capital. Finland is a developed industrial country with major industries such as electronics, telecommunications, chemicals, wood processing and financial services.

## Study

Universities in Finland are not ranked too highly. However, the atmosphere for study and research is wonderful.

Many Finnish universities, especially the newly established Aalto University, tend to be overlooked because of their 'low reputation', and Aalto University has very good art and design and good computer science.

(Finland also gives a sword at the end of a PhD.)

### Costs

Tuition fees in Finland range from approximately EUR 4,000 to EUR 18,000 per year.[StudyInFinland](https://www.studyinfinland.fi/admissions/fees-and-costs) also has an overview page. Different universities also have information on their website to introduce the cost of living in their cities, such as:

- [Cost of Living and Financial Matters - University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/admissions-and-education/international-students/student-life-helsinki/cost-living-and-financial-matters)
- [Tuition and scholarships - Aalto University](https://into.aalto.fi/display/enopisk/Tuition+fees+and+scholarships)
- [Financial matters - Aalto University](https://into.aalto.fi/display/enopisk/Financial+matters)

*The Aalto University website is undergoing a migration process and may change in the future*.

There are several student housing agencies in the Helsinki area, such as HOAS, that offer relatively inexpensive rental housing.

## Employment

Local employment requirements in Finland often require a knowledge of Finnish, making it difficult for non-computer majors to find jobs.

Computer science majors mainly graduate in consulting, i.e. they provide solutions to other companies and earn good salaries. Thus, for computer science students, a certain level of engineering and development skills can make them better able to find a job.

According to data, the median income in Finland in 2022 will be more than €3,300.[^2]

## Residency

For Finland, they do not issue students visas, but residence permits.

At the beginning of 2022, Finland updated its own student residence permit policy, which allows students to obtain a Class A residence permit. And they also give visas to find a job for two years after graduation, which makes it less difficult for international students to find a job after graduation.

For proof of property, Finland requires 6,720€/year in [InfoFinland](https://www.infofinland.fi/zh/moving-to-finland/non-eu-citizens/study-in-finland), which can be reduced when the school provides housing or food. This term can be reduced when the school provides housing or food.

### Residence permit A type

A residence permit is a long-term residence permit that allows the holder to stay and work in Finland, and is usually valid for a period of one to five years, which can be extended on demand.

After five years of holding an A permit, the holder can apply for permanent residence. If certain conditions are met, four years is also sufficient to apply for Finnish citizenship. B

### Residence permit B type

A mine-clearance residence permit is a temporary residence permit that does not count towards the application for permanent residence.

## Transgender medical resources

Student Medical Services, run by [Finnish Student Health Service (FSHS/YTHS)](https://www.yths.fi/en/frontpage/). FSHS provides dental psychology and general outpatient services, and will refer you to other hospitals when the physician cannot handle your condition/request. In the Helsinki metropolitan area it is often redirect to [HUS](https://www.hus.fi/en).

Hormonal medications are relatively easy to obtain in Finland and FSHS can often provide medical advice. After a referral to HUS, if the assigned gender is still in the official documents (e.g. passport), the relevant documents can be provided to HUS for gender change. However, the queue is longer.

In the fall of 2022, the Finnish government submitted a new transgender law that aims to remove the restriction that transgenders must complete a de-sexing procedure in order to undergo a gender change. Feedback from transgenders in Finland says that the new transgender law is effectively BS.

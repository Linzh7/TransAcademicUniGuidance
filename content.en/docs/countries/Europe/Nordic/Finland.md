# Finland

Finland is a country located in Northern Europe, with Helsinki as its capital. Finland is a developed industrial country with major industries such as electronics, telecommunications, chemicals, wood processing and financial services.

## Study

Universities in Finland are not ranked too highly. However, the atmosphere for study and research is wonderful.

Many Finnish universities, especially the newly established Aalto University, tend to be overlooked because of their 'low reputation', and Aalto University has very good art and design and good computer science.

(Finland also gives a sword at the end of a PhD.)

## Accommodation

Most university accommodation is not provided by the university, but by various organizations or companies. In the Helsinki area, common organizations include [HOAS](https://www.hoas.fi/en/), [BOTH](https://bothxhome.fi/en/), [UniHome](https://unihome.fi/en/home).

Among them, [HOAS](https://www.hoas.fi/en/) provides the "Other" gender option in the new [Application System](https://application.hoas.fi/) updated in February 2023.

Most of the rooms offered by [BOTH](https://bothxhome.fi/en/) are gender neutral, such as Studio.

[UniHome](https://unihome.fi/en/home) is similar to above, but offers more short-term apartments.

### Costs

Tuition fees in Finland range from approximately EUR 4,000 to EUR 18,000 per year.[StudyInFinland](https://www.studyinfinland.fi/admissions/fees-and-costs) also has an overview page. Different universities also have information on their website to introduce the cost of living in their cities, such as:

- [Cost of Living and Financial Matters - University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/admissions-and-education/international-students/student-life-helsinki/cost-living-and-financial-matters)
- [Tuition and scholarships - Aalto University](https://into.aalto.fi/display/enopisk/Tuition+fees+and+scholarships)
- [Financial matters - Aalto University](https://into.aalto.fi/display/enopisk/Financial+matters)

*The Aalto University website is undergoing a migration process and may change in the future*.

There are several student housing agencies in the Helsinki area, such as HOAS, that offer relatively inexpensive rental housing.

## Employment

Local employment requirements in Finland often require a knowledge of Finnish, making it difficult for non-computer majors to find jobs.

Computer science majors mainly graduate in consulting, i.e. they provide solutions to other companies and earn good salaries. Thus, for computer science students, a certain level of engineering and development skills can make them better able to find a job.

According to data, the median income in Finland in 2022 will be more than €3,300.[^2]

## Residency

For Finland, they do not issue students visas, but residence permits.

At the beginning of 2022, Finland updated its own student residence permit policy, which allows students to obtain a Class A residence permit. And they also give visas to find a job for two years after graduation, which makes it less difficult for international students to find a job after graduation.

For proof of property, Finland requires 6,720€/year in [InfoFinland](https://www.infofinland.fi/zh/moving-to-finland/non-eu-citizens/study-in-finland), which can be reduced when the school provides housing or food. This term can be reduced when the school provides housing or food.

### Residence permit A type

A residence permit is a long-term residence permit that allows the holder to stay and work in Finland, and is usually valid for a period of one to five years, which can be extended on demand.

After five years of holding an A permit, the holder can apply for permanent residence. If certain conditions are met, four years is also sufficient to apply for Finnish citizenship. B

### Residence permit B type

A mine-clearance residence permit is a temporary residence permit that does not count towards the application for permanent residence.

## Policies and Resources

### Policy

The Finnish Digital Population Authority (DVV) has amended the gender change recognition provisions in accordance with the latest Transgender Act, which is expected to take effect on April 3, 2023.

At that time, the conditions will be:

- Reaching legal age.
- Citizenship/permit to remain.
- An official declaration is issued.

After the application is made, the applicant must reconfirm the application within 30 days to 6 months, after which the application will be processed.

The above information is subject to change after the effective date, please refer to [Sukupuolen vahvistaminen (in Finnish) - DVV](https://dvv.fi/sukupuolen-vahvistaminen) for the latest information.

{{< /hint >}}

Student Medical Services, run by [Finnish Student Health Service (FSHS/YTHS)](https://www.yths.fi/en/frontpage/). FSHS provides dental psychology and general outpatient services, and will refer you to other hospitals when the physician cannot handle your condition/request. In the Helsinki metropolitan area it is often redirect to [HUS](https://www.hus.fi/en).

As an international student, hormonal medications are relatively easy to obtain in Finland and FSHS can often provide a prescription (*this information needs to be further verified*). In case of additional needs, a referral can be requested, but the queue is long. Some transgenders therefore apply for a referral in [GenderGP](../#gendergp) to obtain prescriptions.

On February 1, 2023, Finland passed the gender self-identification act [^3], which allows transgenders to change their gender on their own, without any additional steps such as diagnosis by a doctor, surgery, etc.

Please refer to the website of [kela](https://www.kela.fi/medicine-expenses) for the reimbursement rules for various types of medications such as hormones. Please note that if you are already registered with DVV, you can count towards reimbursement, otherwise you will not. Prices of standard medications can be found on the [Medicinal Products Database - Kela](https://asiointi.kela.fi/laakekys_app/LaakekysApplication?kieli=en) and an additional fee of around 3€ will be charged for picking up the medication at the pharmacy. If you pick up your medication at a pharmacy, you will have to pay an additional delivery fee of about 3 euros.

# Finland

Finland is a country located in Northern Europe, with Helsinki as its capital. Finland is a well-developed industrial country with major industries such as electronics, telecommunications, chemicals, wood processing and financial services.

Finland offers universal health insurance and free education (for its residents). Finland also has a high standard of living and welfare, and a relatively liberal immigration policy.

## Transgender-related resources

For more details before, during and after the application for a residence permit, there is an [article](https://verbose.linzh.me/posts/2023-start-at-finland/) available here.

### Policies

The Finnish Digital Population Authority (DVV) has amended the gender change recognition provisions in accordance with the latest Transgender Act, which has took effect on April 3, 2023. And the conditions are:

- Reaching legal age.
- Citizenship/permit to remain.
- An official declaration is issued.

After the application is made, the applicant must reconfirm the application within 30 days to 6 months, after which the application will be processed.

Student Health Services, by [Finnish Student Health Service](https://www.yths.fi/en/frontpage/). FSHS provides dental psychology and general outpatient services, and will refer you to other hospitals if your condition/request cannot be handled by a physician. In the Helsinki region it is often the [Helsinki University Hospital (HUS)](https://www.hus.fi/en).

As a foreign student, hormonal medications are relatively easy to obtain in Finland and FSHS can often provide prescriptions (*this information needs to be further verified*). If additional needs arise, a referral can be requested, but the queue is longer. As a result, some transgender patients apply for referrals in [GenderGP](../#gendergp) to obtain prescriptions.

On February 1, 2023, Finland passed the gender self-identification bill [^3], which allows transgender people to change their gender without any additional steps such as diagnosis or surgery by a doctor.

Please refer to the [kela](https://www.kela.fi/medicine-expenses) website for reimbursement rules for various medications such as hormones. Please note that reimbursement will count if you are already registered with DVV, otherwise it will not count. Standard drug prices can be found at [Medicinal Products Database - Kela](https://asiointi.kela.fi/laakekys_app/LaakekysApplication?kieli=en) and there is an additional delivery fee of about $3 for picking up the drug at the pharmacy. If you pick up your medication at a pharmacy, there is an additional delivery fee of about $3.

## Studying

Finland's schools are not ranked very high. But the atmosphere of study and research is better.

The University of Finland is not very famous, so many universities, especially the newly established University of Alto, are often overlooked, but the University of Alto has very good art and design and good computer science.

Finland's doctorate will give a sword upon graduation.

## Accommodation

Most university accommodation is not provided by the university, but by institutions or companies. In the Helsingør area, common organizations include [HOAS](https://www.hoas.fi/en/), [BOTH](https://bothxhome.fi/en/), [UniHome](https://unihome.fi/en/home).

Among them, [HOAS](https://www.hoas.fi/en/) provides "Other" gender option in the new [Application System](https://application.hoas.fi/) updated in February 2023.

[BOTH](https://bothxhome.fi/en/) offers most rooms that are gender neutral, such as Studio.

[UniHome](https://unihome.fi/en/home) is similar to the above, but offers more short-term apartments.

### Fees

Tuition fees in Finland range from approximately EUR 4,000 to EUR 18,000 per year. [StudyInFinland](https://www.studyinfinland.fi/admissions/fees-and-costs) also has an overview page. Different schools also have pages with information about the cost of living in their cities, such as.
- [Cost of Living and Financial Matters - University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/admissions-and-education/international-students/student-life-helsinki/cost-living- and-financial-matters)
- Tuition and Scholarships - Aalto University](https://into.aalto.fi/display/enopisk/Tuition+fees+and+scholarships)
- [Financial Matters - Aalto University](https://into.aalto.fi/display/enopisk/Financial+matters)

*The Aalto University website is in the process of being migrated and may be subject to future changes.


## Employment

Local employment requirements in Finland often require a good knowledge of Finnish, which makes it difficult for non-computing majors to find jobs.

The main career path for computer science graduates is consulting, i.e. providing solutions to other companies, which pays better. Therefore, for computer science students, certain engineering and development skills can help them to find a job better.

Data shows that the median income in Finland in 2022 is over €3,300.[^2]

## Residency

Finland does not issue visas to students, but residence permits.

At the beginning of 2022, Finland renewed its residence permit policy for students, so that they can get a Class A residence permit. The visa is also granted for two years after graduation, which makes it less difficult for students to find a job after graduation.

Regarding proof of property, Finland requires 6,720 Euros/year in the [InfoFinland](https://www.infofinland.fi/zh/moving-to-finland/non-eu-citizens/study-in-finland), which can be reduced when the school provides housing or food. The terms can be reduced when the school provides housing or food.

### Class A residence permit

A residence permit is a long-term residence permit that allows the holder to stay and work in Finland, and is usually valid for a period of one to five years, which can be extended on demand.

After five years, the holder can apply for a permanent residence permit. If certain conditions are met, four years is also sufficient to apply for Finnish citizenship. [^1]

### Type B residence permit

Residence permit category B is a temporary residence permit and does not count towards the application for permanent residency.

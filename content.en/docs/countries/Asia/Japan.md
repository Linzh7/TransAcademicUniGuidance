Japanese society is built on a household registration structure, and thus transgenders who want to be recognized by society need to be able to have the conditions to obtain a wife/husband, i.e., they need to pass the external appearance, etc., in order to change their documents; and from a cultural perspective, they need to have the will to marry and have children. In addition, the overall social pressure in East Asia are relatively high, the whole social construction is also relatively traditional, society on [same-sex marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recognition_of_same-sex_unions_in_Japan) attitudes vary widely.

- Insurance, driver's licenses, and individual number cards can be changed by providing medical proof. However, the My Number and residence permit cannot be changed.
- Acquiring proof is relatively easy, and even without medical proof, one can receive proper HRT/GAHT treatment at a hospital.

- There may be middle-aged individuals who intentionally harm others.
- Even hospitals not affiliated with gender identity disorder organizations can issue proof, which can still be used normally. They can also provide psychiatric medication and introduction letters for GAS/SRS in Thailand.

## Naturalization

Permanent residence in Japan is harder than naturalization, so I'll just talk about naturalization below. The fastest time should be five years, and after you finish studying, you can find a job and convert your student visa to a work visa.

However, the language requirement for Japanese work is often not low, so it is recommended to improve Japanese as much as possible. If you are a graduate student (seminarian), the possibility of finding a job also has a certain possibility, a better university can improve the probability, computer, information majors can also improve the probability, but it is not recommended that majors such as literature, history and philosophy bet on this probability, unless the Japanese language is very proficient.

Remember to apply for a master's degree to match your undergraduate degree, cross-disciplinary majors are easy to reject. Because now the Japanese industry also needs more talents.

In addition, if you want to study in a language school, remember not to be absent from school. If you perform well and pass the language score, both work and study will be much easier.

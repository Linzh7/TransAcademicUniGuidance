# Singapore

Singapore is an island nation located in Southeast Asia and is known as the financial center of Asia. Singapore's major industries include finance, aviation, technology, pharmaceuticals, and business services. Singapore is home to Chinese, Indian, Malay and other ethnic groups. The official language is English, but most people also speak Chinese, Malay or Hindi.

Singapore is not very LGBTQA+ inclusive, and only completed the decriminalization of gay sex for men in mid-2022, while at the same time recognizing marriage as a relationship between a "man and a woman" in the constitution. At the same time, there are official restrictions on the promotion of LGBTQA+ content, and the population has become more conservative in its thinking. In some ways, Singapore is only legally open, but still does things in a conservative way in real life.

## Study

NUS and Nanyang Technological University are both very good. The international rankings and recognition are high.

And regarding the difficulty of studying, according to feedback from students in Singapore, TAs are more difficult to study: many students are trying to get higher scores, which creates strong competition.

### Study and related costs

Tuition fees are generally around 150-200k, and may be slightly more expensive for computer studies.

The low to medium level of spending is probably about 60-70,000 a year for accommodation. Food costs are probably close to 40,000 a year. Transportation costs are about 3600 a year.

For a more nourishing life, expect 90,000 a year for accommodation and 60,000 for food.

## Living

Another disadvantage of Singapore is the high cost of living. According to the latest data, Singapore's price index is the fourth highest in the world, about 17% higher than that of the United States.

Food, housing and transportation costs are relatively high in Singapore, but entertainment and electronics are relatively inexpensive. Monthly public transportation passes in Singapore tend to cost around a few hundred RMB, and are cheaper if you only eat at the school cafeteria, but take-out can be much more expensive.

The bigger cost of living comes from renting an apartment. According to data, the average monthly rental price in Singapore ranges from SGD 2,000 to SGD 3,500 (about RMB 1,200 to 2,100).

## Employment

On the issue of employment, it is difficult to find employment in Singapore. According to the feedback of a partner who studied in the above two schools, even if ta participated in various internships, it is not always guaranteed to stay in Singapore after graduation.

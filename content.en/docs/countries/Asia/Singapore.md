# Singapore

Singapore is an island nation located in Southeast Asia and is known as the financial center of Asia. Singapore's major industries include finance, aviation, technology, pharmaceuticals, and business services. Singapore is home to Chinese, Indian, Malay and other ethnic groups. The official language is English, but most people also speak Chinese, Malay or Hindi.

Singapore is not very LGBTQA+ inclusive, and only completed the decriminalization of gay sex for men in mid-2022, while at the same time recognizing marriage as a relationship between a "man and a woman" in the constitution. At the same time, there are official restrictions on the promotion of LGBTQA+ content, and the population has become more conservative in its thinking. In some ways, Singapore is only legally open, but still does things in a conservative way in real life.

### Organizations

Based on feedback and cultural factors, it is generally observed that locals are given priority, which may result in limited support for non-locals. For instance, in the case of the T Shelter program, individuals who are not Singaporeans may face difficulties in accessing the training provided.

- [Oogachaga](https://oogachaga.com/) is one of the largest LGBTQA+ communities in Singapore, offering various services such as counseling, consultation, training, and social activities.
- [The T Project](https://www.thetprojectsg.org/) provides training, shelter, and other facilities.
- [Pink Dot](https://pinkdot.sg/) is an annual LGBTQA+ celebration in Singapore aimed at promoting equality and inclusivity.
- [TransgenderSG](https://transgendersg.com/) provides counseling, consultation, and support groups, while also promoting awareness and understanding of transgender individuals.

## Study

NUS and Nanyang Technological University are both very good. The international rankings and recognition are high.

And regarding the difficulty of studying, according to feedback from students in Singapore, TAs are more difficult to study: many students are trying to get higher scores, which creates strong competition.

### Study and related costs

If you are open to co-living, the typical monthly rental cost would be at least 600 Singapore dollars (SGD). If you prefer not to share accommodation, the starting price would be at least 1000 SGD. Unless your home is located near the school, daily public transportation expenses would amount to around 3 SGD for shorter distances and 5 SGD for slightly longer distances. In terms of food costs, budgeting around 4 SGD per meal (excluding higher-priced dishes) is possible, while regular meals typically range from 6 to 8 SGD. Housing prices have been increasing recently, and future rental costs are expected to become even more expensive. If you have long-term commuting needs, considering the purchase of an electric scooter might be an option.

To save on expenses, it is highly recommended to take advantage of the monthly cashback promotions available through the EZ-Link app. This application allows you to earn up to 3% cashback on selected redemption items, making it the highest cashback option among Singapore's stored-value cards without any preconditions. EZ-Link can be used for convenient store purchases and can also be linked to a MasterCard wallet for point-of-sale transactions. However, it's important to note that not all places in Singapore accept MasterCard/Visa payments. In hawker centers, it is more common to use QR code payment methods.

If your course requires mandatory internships, carefully consider choosing a school unless you are confident in your exceptional abilities that can surpass local candidates, because local protectionism is taken very seriously.

## Living

One downside of living in Singapore is the relatively high cost of living. According to recent data, Singapore ranks fourth globally in terms of the cost of living index, with prices around 17% higher than in the United States.

The costs of food, housing, and transportation in Singapore are relatively high, while prices for entertainment and electronic products are comparatively lower. Monthly passes for public transportation in Singapore typically cost a few hundred Singapore dollars, and eating at school canteens can be relatively affordable, but ordering takeout can be more expensive.

Housing expenses pose a significant cost burden. Data suggests that the average monthly rent in Singapore ranges from SGD 2,000 to SGD 3,500.

Singapore has a considerable number of accessible toilets, so this should not be a major concern as long as one pays attention to their location.

Additionally, it has been reported that individuals from diverse gender and sexual orientations may encounter conservative comments and discrimination in society. However, it is important to note that this information is subjective and should be taken as a reference only.

## Employment

The issue of employment in Singapore is indeed challenging. According to feedback from a peer who studied at the mentioned schools, even with various internships, there is no guarantee of being able to stay in Singapore after graduation.

In Singapore, especially when considering the prospect of working locally, public universities are the preferable choice. This is because private institutions do not allow part-time work, and Singapore requires non-locals to have a minimum amount of work experience. Unless you can demonstrate a significant advantage in a specific project, it can be difficult to surpass local talents. Non-public university students only have one month after graduation to seek job opportunities.

The typical recruitment process is as follows:

1. For hiring fresh graduates, recruitment websites limited to Singaporeans or permanent residents (PR), such as My Careers Future, are commonly used.
2. For hiring non-fresh graduates, candidates are generally expected to have 3 to 5 years of work experience.
3. It is challenging to find job positions for fresh graduates that are not listed on platforms like My Careers Future. If you come across a job posting on another website, it is likely to indicate that the company will not provide work visa application support.

In summary, employment prospects for fresh graduates may be challenging. 

NOTE! If you eventually apply for a Work Permit for employment, please note that the applicant must **not be in Singapore** during the application process. Furthermore, in the current post-pandemic period, Singapore requires individuals to have received both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine in order to apply for a work visa.

[^2]: The eligibility for participation in this program is limited to individuals aged 21 and above, who hold permanent residency (PR) or Singaporean citizenship. This information is based on feedback from applicants, and I have screenshots of email replies as evidence. However, the actual need for such shelters among local residents is still subject to further discussion. - ❄️

# Regions and countries

It is important for us to choose a region to study, work, and live in. In a place that suits us, we can make sure that we will not be hurt, that we can develop ourselves better, and then we will have more power to build our community and improve the situation around the world.

## Surveys and Reports

There is a worldwide [survey of LGBTQA+ rights](https://www.asherfergusson.com/lgbtq-travel-safety/) published by [Asher & Lyric](https://www.asherfergusson.com/).

[Rainbow Europe](https://www.rainbow-europe.org/) also provides more detailed statistics on European countries, with specific information available on the [Europe page](../../docs/countries/Europe/).

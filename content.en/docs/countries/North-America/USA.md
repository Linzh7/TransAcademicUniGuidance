# United States of America

The United States of America is currently the world's leading country in science and technology, and offers a relatively sophisticated system in many areas, including education and employment. Although the law prohibits discrimination against transgenders, transgenders are still treated unfairly in many ways, such as prejudice, violence, harassment and some local laws.

## Study

The United States has a large number of top schools in engineering, science, business, medicine and many other fields, as well as a very large number of head schools, etc. From the point of view of teaching quality it can be said that American education is quite well guaranteed.

However, the biggest problem in the United States is that red states (conservative states) and blue states (liberal states) have different attitudes towards the rights of transgender people. In addition, even within liberal states, there are still transphobic and homophobic attitudes and behaviors.

If you are going to a blue state, please check carefully about transgender laws and health care coverage. 
**If you are going to a red state, please make sure to double check the state's transgender criminalization, laws and regulations regarding transgender**.

### Cost

The top schools in the United States tend to be private universities and therefore have very high tuition costs without scholarships. Also, the cost varies from school to school and we only provide a non-exhaustive list of results. Therefore, it is recommended that you check the cost of tuition at the college of your choice.

According to the College Board, the average tuition in 2022 will be around $26,000 for public universities and $36,000 for private universities. In addition, there is a deposit, the amount of which varies by variable.

## Employment

Employment varies from university to university, so if you already have a target university, you can check the data for that university directly.

Uniformly speaking, the employment situation depends mainly on the region and industry. For example, there is a high demand for graduates in, for example, technology and financial services. Developed states such as Northeast, California, etc. **Note that while Texas is developed, Texas is a red state and has criminalized child gender confirmation surgery. **

The following are U.S. Department of Labor figures for 2022 (non-foreign student employment rates).
Healthcare: employment rate of about 80% with an average salary of about $70,000/year.
Technology: Employment rate of about 75%, with an average salary of about $70,000/year.
Business and Finance: Employment rate is about 70%, with an average salary of about $50,000/year.
Education: Employment rate is about 65% with an average salary of about $50,000/year.

## Visas

### Student Visas

- F-1 International Student Visa: The most common type of student visa that allows students to pursue full-time study in the U.S., including universities, graduate schools, community colleges, etc. The F-1 International Student Visa is usually valid for the duration of the student's studies plus a 60-day stay, but students may also apply for an [OPT](USA/#opt) visa for an internship during the period of use.

- J-1 Graduate Exchange Student Visa: This is a student visa created by the U.S. government to facilitate international academic exchanges and allows students to conduct graduate exchange studies in the U.S. The J-1 Graduate Exchange Student Visa is usually valid for the duration of the student's studies plus a 30-day stay.

- M-1 Vocational Training Student Visa: This is a student visa created by the U.S. government to facilitate international vocational training exchanges and allows students to pursue vocational training in the U.S. The M-1 Vocational Training Student Visa is usually valid for the duration of the student's studies plus a 30-day period of stay.

- H-1B Professional Work Visa: Allows you to work in the U.S. It is the visa that is often drawn to work after graduation.

### Student Work Visa

There are two types of visas for employment while studying \ after studying, CPT (Curricular Practical Training) and OPT (Optional Practical Training).

#### CPT

CPT (Curricular Practical Training) is a type of internship for international students at U.S. universities that allows students to do an internship within the U.S. after completing their degree studies, usually as part of an F-1 student visa for international students.

Students need to have the support and approval of their school when applying for a CPT visa. The school needs to ensure that the student's internship experience fits into the student's program of study. Students must follow certain rules while on the CPT visa, including not staying for more than a 90-day period without work and needing to obtain employment within the validity period.

CPT is valid while enrolled in school, but is considered full time if the student works more than 20 hours per week. **Full-time CPT for more than 12 months may affect subsequent graduation applications for OPT without employment.**

#### OPT

OPT (Optional Practical Training) is a short-term work visa for students at U.S. colleges and universities. This visa is attached to the student's F-1 student visa, so in order to apply for an OPT visa, the student must first have an F-1 student visa.

The OPT visa is usually valid for 12 months, but can be extended to 24 months for students in **Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields**. Students are often required to specify a specific internship program when applying for an OPT visa and to report to the university on the progress of the internship during the internship.

Students may apply for an OPT visa prior to graduation or after graduation. When applying for an OPT visa, students are required to provide proof from their school that they have graduated or are about to graduate.

The process for applying for an OPT visa includes.

1. Obtain an application form from the school's International Student Affairs Office and complete the application packet.

1. send the application form and required documents (including proof of school, identification documents, etc.) to the U.S. Immigration Service (USCIS)

1. Wait for USCIS to review the application.

1. If the application is approved, the student will be able to work in the U.S. after graduation.

### Employment Visa

1. H-1B Professional Work Visa: Issued to foreign nationals with highly specialized skills to work within the U.S. for up to six years.

1. E-2 Investor Visa: Issued to aliens who invest in the U.S. and may work within the U.S. for an indefinite period of time.

1. L-1 Corporate Transfer Visa: Issued to an officer or professional of a company in the U.S., who may work in the U.S. for up to five years.

1. O-1 Exceptional Talent Visa: Issued to aliens who have made outstanding contributions in the fields of science, arts, education, entertainment, or business and may work in the United States for an indefinite period of time.

1. TN Visa: Issued to professionals from Canada and Mexico who may work within the United States for up to three years.

The U.S. H-1B visa abstraction policy has changed frequently in recent years. Typically, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security accepts H-1B visa applications beginning April 1 of each year and begins issuing H-1B visas on October 1 of each year. However, because the demand for H-1B visas far exceeds the supply, the government uses a lottery to determine recipients.

1. this country is crap, no comment. (No reason, capitalist government not acting, homeless people everywhere. The streets are dirty and disorganized, hostile people exist everywhere, not just against transgender people, but probably against minorities as well.)
1. there are no special details about applying to *US colleges*. (Just apply and be done with it)
1. more scholarships, human rights persecution masters. (Even for a master's degree, enough scholarships can bring the cost to European levels. See the next article about human rights.)
1. you do not solve them they solve you. (Do not believe that the school is looking out for your interests, if your presence infringes on the school's interests, even if you are right, will be 100% fucked)
1. about 50% of people are assholes. (referring to hostility towards transgender people)

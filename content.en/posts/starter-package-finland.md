# Finland Transgender Newcomer's Guide

Mainly for the Helsinki region. Last updated on August 5, 2023.

## Before Arriving in Finland

In theory, do not bring any prescription medication into the Schengen Area without a prescription, and do not exceed one month for over-the-counter medications (check border control regulations). When you have a prescription, you are allowed to carry the medication indicated on the prescription, and the quantity should not exceed six months.

### Applying for a Residence Permit

[EnterFinland](https://enterfinland.fi/) offers various types of residence permit applications. For non-EU users, a successful application often comes with a social security number, but there may be exceptions for some non-long-term visas (remember this number, it's often used below).

The estimated approval time can be found on the aforementioned website.

**Remember to check the effective date! Try to arrive in Finland as early as possible.** There are quite a few things that can only be done locally in Finland, such as some of the details mentioned below, and getting familiar with the environment.

### Student Apartments

There's more content on the Finnish page of this website, so I won't repeat the information here.

Since schools do not manage accommodation, most of it is provided by other institutions. In the Helsinki region, the main provider [HOAS](https://hoas.fi/en/) offers a third-gender option. Other accommodations are often single rooms, so there usually aren't gender issues.

### Schedule a Registration with DVV

Try to choose the day of arrival or the next day, so you can save on the HSL day ticket. After registration, you will get a paper indicating your student status, keep this proof so you can buy a student card at the HSL office. Since DVV registration takes two weeks to a month, most public services are not available during this time, but at least you can buy a student public transport ticket.

### Schedule an Appointment at the Police Station to Order an ID Card

You need to wait until DVV registration is successful to initiate the request, and since we can't predict the expected approval time, theoretically you can schedule it a month after the registration. Alternatively, you can choose not to make an appointment and just go to the police station to queue (more details below).

### School Authentication

Most schools require some authentication to grant corresponding network permissions. This process can be completed online or offline. Offline is much more convenient, so if possible, it's better to arrive in Finland early.

But if for various reasons you can't arrive early, there are usually online applications. Each school is different, so contact the coordinator for more help, such as needing to schedule, video calls, etc.

## After Arriving in Finland

### HSL Public Transport

Helsinki's public transport is managed by HSL. You can download the App and register in advance, then buy your ticket a few minutes before you need to take the bus or train. But remember, you must buy your ticket before boarding.

If you need to travel from the airport to the city center, which is where most of the procedures need to be done, you need to buy a ticket for **ABC** zones because the airport is in zone C. Also, if you plan to visit zone C in the coming days, you can buy a day ticket; otherwise, you can just buy a single ticket for ABC zones and then a day ticket for AB zones.

In most cases, an AB zone ticket is sufficient. If you're going to places like IKEA, you might need a C zone ticket. Just after arrival, don't buy for too long a period, just until the day you register with DVV. Once you've registered with DVV, even without results, you can still use the provided student proof to buy a student card at HSL offices like the one at the central station.

### School Authentication

If done offline, it's usually just going to a designated place, showing your passport or ID. But we usually don't have an ID card when we first arrive, so just use your passport. Then the process can be completed quickly.

### Finnish Student Health Service (FSHS/YTHS)

In theory, you can call FSHS as soon as you arrive to explain your transgender identity and request prescriptions, but if DVV registration is not complete, you might only get the prescription without further processing. Since it takes

 some time to issue, you need to plan how to manage this period. (Hint: stock up on necessary medications)

### Mobile SIM Card

Once you have a social security number, you can buy a postpaid mobile SIM card. DNA might not let you buy because 'you haven't been in Finland long enough'. Elisa/Telia usually can, but there may also be a situation where you need to 'prepay a certain amount of euros' to use it. In such a case, try another provider; usually, one of them will let you use their service without prepayment but may limit functions like long-distance and premium-rate calls (which you mostly won't need).

Service at physical stores often comes with a monthly discount of a few euros, lasting half a year to a year.

Don't sign any fixed-term contracts, so you can freely switch providers with number portability.

### Police Station ID Card Order

If appointments are full, directly going to the police station to queue is an option. Remember to bring your passport and passport-sized photos, which can save money and time. However, it's recommended to be at the door 15 minutes before opening, so you can be served quickly. If you wait one or two hours after opening, you'll have to wait longer. You should be able to collect it in about one or two weeks, remember to bring your passport when collecting.

### Ordering a Kela Card

In theory, you don't need to go to a Kela point, just download the PDF, print it out, sign it, and then drop it off at the mailbox at Kela's door. Two documents:
- [Y 77e](https://www.kela.fi/benefit-forms/Y77e.pdf)
- [SV 157e](https://www.kela.fi/benefit-forms/SV157e.pdf)

## After DVV Registration

### Bank Account

Here, if you have an ID card, it's very convenient to also set up online banking authentication, killing two birds with one stone. The three major banks Nordia/OP/Danske Bank have English interfaces and many branches. S-market and K-market also offer banking services, with a 5% discount at their supermarkets.

If you want to buy insurance (and have 100 euros to spare), consider OP. With 100 euros, you can become an OP member (100 euros refunded upon cancellation), then enjoy OP's insurance benefits, such as significantly reduced deductibles.

If you are a member of various industry associations, like [TEK (Academic Engineers and Architects Union)](https://www.tek.fi/en), consider Danske Bank. [Benefits provided by TEK](https://www.tek.fi/en/services-and-benefits/membership-benefits/danske-banks-benefits).

### Finnish Student Health Service (FSHS/YTHS)

Get your hormones from here. Contact YTHS and say you are transgender and need hormones. If you have already successfully registered with DVV, hormones/anti-androgens are included in your annual reimbursement quota. If not yet registered, you can still get them, but they won't be included in the quota.

For how to get reimbursed, see Kela's explanation [here](https://www.kela.fi/medicine-expenses).

### Home Insurance

There are many options for insurance, such as the aforementioned OP Bank insurance services, which seem to offer good deals if you use their discounts, but I haven't used them so no comment.

There's also [if.fi](https://www.if.fi/en/private-customers) which supports English. I recommend at least using the Extensive plan, as it covers accidental damage, like if you drop your phone or your computer suddenly malfunctions.

## After Getting an ID Card

### Mobile/Bank Identity Authentication

Both require an ID card.

Mobile identity authentication is done at the service center and is quick. But this authentication is charged for, a few euros per month.

Bank identity authentication is done at the branch, but banks often give you a separate random ID, which is hard to remember but free.

## Miscellaneous

### Frank Electronic Student Card

In theory, as soon as you are admitted (and prove it), you can get an electronic student card, which suffices for most dining situations. Of course, you can also buy a physical card, but there's an additional card-making fee.

### Kierratyskeskus Capital Region Second-Hand Recycling Center

The Finnish second-hand market is extremely developed. Show your student card at Kierratyskeskus to prove your student status, get a 20% discount, and receive a card. This is quite a good deal, as second-hand shops have good quality, reasonable prices, and even offer returns if you're not satisfied.

### More Practical Information

[infoFinland.fi](https://www.infofinland.fi), the site has Chinese, but it seems the content is not as comprehensive as the English version.

# A Brief Guide to Name Changes for Transgender Individuals in Finland

**In this article, "you" is universally referred to as "ni." We apologize for any instances where this standard was not maintained.**

Name changes already made outside of Finland can be updated for free. Please refer to [this website](https://dvv.fi/en/registration-of-a-name-change-performed-abroad).

## How to Submit an Application

Note that if you wish to change your gender marker as well, refer to [Confirmation of gender - DVV](https://dvv.fi/en/confirmation-of-gender). After changing your gender, you can change your name for free. Remember, you must reconfirm within **30 days to 6 months** after changing your gender.

The process is as follows:
- Strong identity verification (e.g., bank, MobileID) allows for the use of online services.
- For confirming self-identified gender and other reasons, if online services are not an option, use an electronic form with strong identity verification.
- Download and fill out the form. Then either:
  - 1. Print and mail it to the specified address.
  - 2. Save securely and send to an encrypted email address (ending in .s).

An explanation of encrypted email follows below.

### Changing Your Forename

The details are outlined here: [Change forename (forename)](https://dvv.fi/en/changing-forename).

For gender affirmation, those under 15 need a guardian’s consent; those 15 and older can apply independently. Specific instructions are provided below.

### Changing Your Surname

Key points are summarized here: [Change surname (surname) - DVV](https://dvv.fi/en/changing-forename):
- You must have a surname.

Further details are clearly stated in the document. It's mandatory to have a surname, hmmmm.

## Name Service & Online Forms

Using strong identity verification, navigate to the main page/form, and proceed to the relevant section to submit a new name/surname/full name.

Note that only the first letter of each word can be uppercase; the rest must be lowercase.

Under the Name Act, you can change your name if:
1. More than 5 people use the name.
2. The applicant has a cultural connection justifying the name according to that culture's norms.
3. The name is justified for religious reasons.
4. Other reasons.

Given the ambiguity of "other reasons," it's advisable to seek the first three methods. For instance, if your preferred name is used by >5 people, as found in [Name service - DVV](https://dvv.fi/en/name-service), you can use the first method. If not, the second method may apply, such as rationalizing your name using Pinyin or another Latinized version of Chinese. I’m not well-versed in religious justifications, so I can’t offer much information there.

After submission, online services will require a fee of 60 or 120 euros, regardless of success.

## Printing and Mailing/Sending Encrypted Forms

DVV will take 1-2 months to process your submission. You’ll receive an invoice, and upon payment, the application process will begin.

## After the Review

A letter will be sent to your address. If the name in the window of the envelope is the one you prefer, congratulations, ni, your chosen name has been reclaimed!

## Appeals

To be updated.

## Encrypted Email

Simply add `.s` to the recipient's email address.
For example, `nimet@dvv.fi` becomes `nimet@dvv.fi.s`.

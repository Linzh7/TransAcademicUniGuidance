Singapore\u0026rsquo;s major industries include finance, aviation, technology, pharmaceuticals, and business services. Singapore is home to Chinese, Indian, Malay and other ethnic groups. The official language is English, but most people also speak Chinese, Malay or Hindi.\nSingapore\u0026rsquo;s level of acceptance towards the LGBTQA+ community is not considered high. It was only in mid-2022 that Singapore decriminalized male same-sex sexual activity, while reaffirming in parliament that marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman to avoid any challenges in that regard. The authorities also impose restrictions on the promotion of LGBTQA+ content, and public attitudes tend to lean towards conservatism. From certain perspectives, Singapore may appear to be legally open but still operates in a conservative manner in everyday life. 1\nLGBT rights in Singapore from wikipedia\nTransgender related # Organizations # Based on feedback and cultural factors, it is generally observed that locals are given priority, which may result in limited support for non-locals. For instance, in the case of the T Shelter program, individuals who are not Singaporeans may face difficulties in accessing the training provided. 2\nOogachaga is one of the largest LGBTQA+ communities in Singapore, offering various services such as counseling, consultation, training, and social activities. The T Project provides training, shelter, and other facilities. Pink Dot is an annual LGBTQA+ celebration in Singapore aimed at promoting equality and inclusivity. TransgenderSG provides counseling, consultation, and support groups, while also promoting awareness and understanding of transgender individuals. Organizations providing assistance and counseling services:\nLaw Society of Singapore - Pro Bono Services SupportGoWhere - Protection Specialist Centre (PSC) Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE) Pave If you encounter any violence-related situations, you can generally call the helpline numbers provided by the above organizations for consultation.\nHRT/GAHT # HRT Overview in Singapore - MtF.wiki\nEducation # Both the National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) are excellent choices. They have high international rankings and recognition.\nIn terms of academic difficulty, according to feedback from students, the level of difficulty is relatively high. Many students strive to achieve higher scores, leading to intense competition.\nCosts and Finances # If you are open to sharing accommodations, the monthly rental cost typically starts at 600 Singapore dollars (SGD). If you prefer not to share, the starting price would be at least 1000 SGD. Unless your family resides near the school, the daily transportation cost by public bus is approximately 3 SGD (for closer locations) or 5 SGD (for slightly farther places). The cost of each meal can be around 4 SGD if you opt for budget options (excluding more expensive dishes, which can range from 6 to 8 SGD). Housing prices have been continuously rising, and future rental costs are expected to become more expensive. If you have long-term commuting needs, consider purchasing an electric scooter as an option.\nIf you wish to save expenses, it is important to consider participating in the monthly cashback program offered by the EZ-Link APP. This application allows you to earn up to 3% cashback on selected redemption items and is known as the application with the highest cashback available among Singapore\u0026rsquo;s stored value cards, without any preconditions. EZ-Link can be used for purchases at convenience stores or via a MasterCard wallet for transactions at POS terminals. However, it should be noted that not all places in Singapore support MasterCard/Visa payment methods. In hawker centers, it is more common to use QR code payments.\nIf your course requires compulsory internships, please carefully consider whether you want to choose a school with this requirement unless you are confident in your abilities to surpass local students, as local protectionism is strictly observed.\nIf the school accepts payment through Flywire and offers local payment options, you can choose to use your domestic Visa/MasterCard along with an international card to avoid high currency conversion fees charged by Flywire. If this is not possible, and if conditions permit, you can use Bank of China/Industrial and Commercial Bank of China for cross-border remittance between banks, which can waive remittance fees and provide the lowest exchange rate. Transfers are typically completed on the same day for morning transactions and the next business day for afternoon transactions.\nFor users from mainland China who wish to use CNY, it is recommended to use WeChat for daily expenses (with a lower exchange rate). It is necessary to enter the mini-program to obtain the weekly exchange rate card, and WeChat Pay is more widely accepted. In some places such as Food Junction, they refer to it as NETS QR. Please note that support for WeChat Pay implies the use of NETS QR payment, but not all NETS QR terminals support WeChat Pay.\nFor informal payments, except at the post office (where Visa/MasterCard are separate payment methods), using Visa/MasterCard contactless payment is referred to as Paywave.\nRegarding physical banks, DBS/Standard Chartered does not have a minimum monthly deposit requirement, UOB/OCBC requires 1000 SGD, Bank of China requires 200 SGD, and HSBC requires 2000 SGD. Other banks are not recommended because although they may not have a minimum deposit requirement, they might close your account if your spending is insufficient after 6 months. The first deposit must meet the minimum deposit requirement, and subsequent failure to meet the minimum deposit requirement may incur a monthly fee of 2-5 SGD. OCBC exempts individuals below 26 years of age from transaction fees.\nLiving # One downside of living in Singapore is the relatively high cost of living. You can gather more information about this through the consumer price index and other sources. Specifically, the cost of food, housing, and transportation in Singapore is relatively high, while the prices of entertainment and electronic products are relatively low. There are many accessible toilets available in Singapore, so you don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry too much about this issue. However, it has been reported that individuals from diverse sexual orientations and gender identities may encounter conservative comments and discrimination in society. Please note that this information is subjective and should be taken as a reference only. Students with a valid student pass can enjoy a 50% discount on movie tickets at Singapore cinemas on weekdays before 5 PM (e.g., Shaw.sg, Golden Village). [This information is time-sensitive] If you take a taxi late at night, unlucky drivers may insist on cash payment only. If you experience social anxiety, you can use Grab\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;quiet ride\u0026rdquo; option for taxi bookings. Accommodation # A significant portion of the living expenses in Singapore comes from rental housing. According to data, the average monthly rental price ranges from SGD 2,000 to SGD 3,500.\nFor new students who are unsure about accommodation options, some schools may recommend housing choices (excluding schools like NTU that have their own dormitories and offer lower rental rates to students). These accommodations often come with a binding condition of paying a high rental amount for the first three months. If possible, it is advisable to rent an entire apartment or studio with 2-3 people, which can help reduce costs to an average of 600-800 SGD per person (depending on the number of tenants). If you are renting a Housing Development Board (HDB) flat instead of a private residence, you will need to pay a stamp duty of 0.4%. Unless you are a Singaporean or Malaysian citizen (including permanent residents, PR), the maximum rental duration for the same person at an HDB address is 2 years. However, HDB flats, being managed by the government, generally maintain a higher quality. The minimum rental period should not be less than 6 months.\nIf you come across an HDB flat where the owner or authorized occupier is \u0026ldquo;not staying with the tenant,\u0026rdquo; meaning they are renting out individual rooms rather than living with the tenant, it is highly likely that the rental is illegal or involves a subletting situation. This is because Singaporean law requires the owner to supervise the tenant and all visitors must be registered in the HDB database. You can decide whether to report such cases based on your personal choice.3 According to HDB regulations, the flat owners and all authorized occupants must continue to live in the flat with the tenants during the rental period. If the flat owners and authorized occupants do not reside in the flat, the approval for renting out the bedroom(s) will be automatically revoked. These regulations do not apply to private residences.\nEmployment # The issue of employment in Singapore is indeed challenging. According to feedback from a peer who studied at the mentioned schools, even with various internships, there is no guarantee of being able to stay in Singapore after graduation.\nIn Singapore, especially when considering the prospect of working locally, public universities are the preferable choice. This is because private institutions do not allow part-time work, and Singapore requires non-locals to have a minimum amount of work experience. Unless you can demonstrate a significant advantage in a specific project, it can be difficult to surpass local talents. Non-public university students only have one month after graduation to seek job opportunities.\nThe typical recruitment process is as follows:\nFor hiring fresh graduates, recruitment websites limited to Singaporeans or permanent residents (PR), such as My Careers Future, are commonly used. For hiring non-fresh graduates, candidates are generally expected to have 3 to 5 years of work experience. It is challenging to find job positions for fresh graduates who are not listed on platforms like My Careers Future. If you come across a job posting on another website, it is likely to indicate that the company will not provide work visa application support. In summary, employment prospects for fresh graduates may be challenging.\nNOTE! If you eventually apply for a Work Permit for employment, please note that the applicant must not be in Singapore during the application process. Furthermore, in the current post-pandemic period, Singapore requires individuals to have received both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to apply for a work visa.\nThe community life, employment, and education aspects of this article are provided by ❄️.\nTransgender Healthcare Intervention Threat by Singapore Ministry of Education (in Chinese)\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe eligibility for participation in this program is limited to individuals aged 21 and above, who hold permanent residency (PR) or Singaporean citizenship.

The United States of America is currently the world\u0026rsquo;s leading country in science and technology and offers a relatively sophisticated system in many areas, including education and employment. Although the law prohibits discrimination against transgenders, transgenders are still treated unfairly in many ways, such as prejudice, violence, harassment, and some local laws.\nErin Reed published the 2022 Final Anti-Trans Legislation Risk Map.

Additionally, even within blue states, there may be instances of transphobia or homophobia, or incidents where students are harmed in the interest of the school. Therefore, it is recommended to gather more information on school-specific Reddit or other discussion forums. Furthermore, if your academic path is strongly tied to a specific advisor, you can obtain more evaluations about that individual through Rate My Professors.\nIf you are going to a blue state, please check carefully about transgender laws and health care coverage.

In the US system, undergraduate education includes:\nLiberal Arts Colleges (LAC) Research Universities For vocational education, there are Community Colleges, which have low tuition fees and shorter study durations.\nIn comparison to community colleges, larger universities are commonly referred to as \u0026ldquo;Big U\u0026rdquo; and are mainly research universities. Generally, reputable universities are Land-grant universities that receive federal subsidies and therefore must comply with federal regulations regarding gender and racial discrimination (Education Amendments of 1972).\nFor smaller schools, it is important to pay attention to accreditation. Accreditation is similar to the accreditation by the Chinese Ministry of Education, but in the US, it is done through alliances. Business schools can have accreditations such as AACSB, ACBSP, and IACBE. These accreditations are international (so some business schools in Hong Kong and China also have them), and schools with these accreditations are generally good, but not all business schools have them. Without accreditation, further academic advancement may be hindered.\nIn addition, for undergraduate rankings in the US, the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education is a useful reference (mainly for the postgraduate stage, R2/R1 universities are very good). US News rankings are also worth considering, but note that liberal arts colleges and universities are ranked separately.\nThe choice of major is very important. For example, Georgetown\u0026rsquo;s International Relations program is considered the best in the US, but other majors may not be as strong. The Media Studies program at the University of Amsterdam is excellent (linguistics is also good), but the focus of the entire school revolves around media studies, so other programs may not be as strong.\nMoody Bible College of Chicago, a fundamentalist evangelical theological school, was sued under Title IX for not admitting female students to specific programs after receiving federal funding. Generally, schools with religious backgrounds may not have a positive attitude towards the transgender community, but Notre Dame may be an exception, and they provide generous scholarships.\nAs a side note, in the US, \u0026ldquo;full-ride\u0026rdquo; refers to a full scholarship (usually covering full tuition but not necessarily living expenses). \u0026ldquo;Standardized scores\u0026rdquo; refer to standardized test scores, which generally include SAT/ACT and AP scores, as well as language proficiency (or under different high school education systems, IB/A-Level, as mentioned later). \u0026ldquo;Need-aware\u0026rdquo; means that scholarships/subsidies require proof of income, \u0026ldquo;merit-based\u0026rdquo; means scholarships are based on maintaining academic performance (which can be very stressful and difficult), and \u0026ldquo;need-blind\u0026rdquo; means scholarships are given unconditionally (only Stanford, Harvard, and MIT offer need-blind scholarships to international undergraduate students).\nThis chapter was written by \u0026ldquo;Jeremiah Patrick Hsu\u0026rdquo; Cost # The top schools in the United States tend to be private universities and therefore have very high tuition costs without scholarships.\nSome colleges and universities may reimburse transgender individuals for medical expenses, but it is important to note that some states may not be transgender-friendly, so please consider this.\nColleges and Universities that Cover Transition-Related Medical Expenses Under Student Health Insurance - campuspride.org Some schools will also provide information on their official websites, such as.\nInsurance Benefits for Transgender Students - Berkeley Transgender Health Benefits - University of California Some organizations also provide references to costs and considerations in the United States, such as:\nFinancing \u0026amp; Support for Gender Confirmation Surgery - Laura Dorwart Employment # Uniformly speaking, the employment situation depends mainly on the region and industry. For example, there is a high demand for graduates in, for example, technology and financial services. Developed states such as Northeast, California, etc.\nNote that while Texas is kinda developed, however, Texas also has criminalized child gender confirmation surgery.\nVisas # Student Visas # F-1 Student Visa: The most common type of student visa that allows students to undertake full-time study in the United States, including universities, graduate schools, community colleges, etc. The validity of the F-1 student visa is generally the duration of the student\u0026rsquo;s academic program plus a 60-day grace period. During this time, students can also apply for an OPT visa for internships. J-1 Visa: This is a non-immigrant visa issued by the United States to research scholars, professors, and exchange visitors participating in programs to promote cultural exchange. It allows students to undertake graduate exchange studies in the United States. The J-1 visa is valid for the length of the academic program plus a 30-day grace period. M-1 Vocational Student Visa: Established by the U.S. government to promote international vocational training exchanges, this visa allows students to undertake vocational training in the United States. The validity period is typically the length of the student\u0026rsquo;s program plus a 30-day grace period. H-1B Work Visa: This visa allows you to work in the United States and is commonly drawn after graduation. J-1 # Apart from serving as visiting scholars, common ways to obtain a J-1 visa include becoming an outsourced worker or an au pair. Au pairs are unmarried individuals aged between 18-26 from foreign countries who assist in child care in a country other than their place of residence. Both the United States and many other countries offer au pair programs.\nFor outsourced workers, job opportunities are mainly concentrated in the hospitality industry. The pay rate is around $15-22 per hour, with a typical workweek of 38 hours. However, accommodation is at their own expense, though some companies may offer discounted accommodations or employer-provided lodging facilities. Sometimes opportunities for maintenance engineers and software developers arise, but such opportunities are rare. The J-1 visa is a non-immigrant visa without dual intent1, but can be renewed under terms and conditions. Generally, if you are a sophomore or higher in college or have just graduated, or have five years of relevant experience (actually, three years are sufficient), you are eligible for a J-1 visa.\nFor au pairs, a basic high school diploma is generally sufficient. Airfare, accommodation, and food are covered by the employer. The concept of au pair originated in Europe, aiming for cultural exchange and language acquisition. The wage is usually the federal minimum wage; some employers may offer better pay, but this is not common. The duration is generally about a year, extendable up to two years. Au pairs are not renewable. The advantage is that the job includes full board and lodging, so you have little or no expenditures. Agencies offering such services usually charge a significant upfront fee.\nWork Visas for Students # There are two types of employment visas during/after study, CPT (Curricular Practical Training) and OPT (Optional Practical Training).\nCPT # CPT (Curricular Practical Training) is an internship opportunity offered to international students in American universities. It allows students to undertake internships in the United States after completing their degree studies and is typically a part of the F-1 student visa.\nStudents must obtain the support and approval of the school when applying for CPT visas. The school needs to ensure that the internship experience is aligned with the student\u0026rsquo;s academic plan. Students must adhere to specific rules while using the CPT visa, including not exceeding a 90-day period of unemployment and securing employment within the validity period.\nCPT is valid during school, but if you work more than 20 hours per week, it is considered full-time. If full-time CPT exceeds 12 months, it may affect the application for post-graduation OPT.\nOPT # OPT (Optional Practical Training) is a short-term work visa aimed at students of American institutions. This visa is an extension of the F-1 student visa, so to apply for an OPT visa, students must first hold an F-1 student visa.\nThe OPT visa is generally valid for 12 months but can be extended to 24 months for students in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Students generally need to specify a particular internship program when applying for OPT and report the internship\u0026rsquo;s progress to the school during the internship.\nStudents can apply for OPT either before or after graduation. When applying, they need to provide proof from the school, indicating they have graduated or are about to graduate.\nThe process for applying for OPT includes:\nObtaining an application form from the international student affairs office of the school and filling out the required information.\nSending the application form and necessary documents (including school proof, identification, etc.) to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).\nWaiting for the USCIS to review the application.\nIf approved, the student can work in the United States after graduation.\nEmployment Visas # H-1B Professional Work Visa: Specially designed for foreign skilled workers, the H-1B visa allows employees to work in the United States under specific conditions. The validity of the H-1B visa is generally six years but can be extended under certain conditions.\nL-1 Visa: Designed for senior executives or managers of multinational corporations. The L-1 visa allows these executives or managers to work in the United States for a period of one to five years. The L-1 visa also allows family members to accompany the employee.\nResidency # To be added.\nComments \u0026amp; Feedbacks # We use italics to add missing parts of the grammar for comprehension.

For non-immigrant visas, displaying an intention to stay in the U.S. permanently often leads to visa denial. In contrast, dual-intent visas, although not designed for immigration, permit applicants to express a willingness to potentially immigrate.

After the first month, blood tests are conducted, followed by checks every three months.\nIn Canada, after obtaining the first long-term prescription, it becomes relatively easy to renew it at places like school clinics, along with periodic blood tests.\nHowever, there may be instances where some universities are unable to provide prescriptions and require a \u0026ldquo;referral\u0026rdquo; to other clinics. In such cases, there might be unforeseen circumstances, such as wait times.\nEducation # Canada\u0026rsquo;s universities are primarily public institutions, making tuition much cheaper compared to the United States.

Many programs have different application pathways for domestic and international students, especially academic master\u0026rsquo;s programs, which may not be open to international students but often offer a combined Master\u0026rsquo;s and Ph.D. programs as an alternative.\nColleges and universities have different systems. For instance, some colleges may not grant access to the country\u0026rsquo;s healthcare resources and require additional fees, while university students can obtain healthcare insurance similar to that of Canadian citizens. However, in most cases, dental and eye care are not included and require additional payments.\nCanadian students are not restricted from working during their studies.\nCosts # College tuition fees are relatively cheaper, while universities can be more expensive. Tuition costs can range from CAD 10k/year to CAD 30k/year, undergraduate programs typically cost CAD 20-60k/year, and international graduate students pay around CAD 10k/year. Doctoral students receive grants of approximately CAD 20k-30k/year and are exempt from tuition fees.\nAccording to feedback, doctoral grants are sufficient to cover living expenses but may not leave much room for savings.\nOverall, the cost of living is relatively high. For example, renting in downtown Toronto costs approximately CAD 1,200/month, while suburbs may require CAD 800/month.\nEmployment # Canada\u0026rsquo;s economy relies mainly on the service and manufacturing industries.\nResidency # Students and Post-Graduation # After graduating in Canada, one can obtain an open work permit known as a Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) for a minimum of 1 year and a maximum of 3 years.

The duration of the PGWP depends on the length of the graduate degree; for example, a 1-year degree results in a 1-year PGWP, while a 5-year degree leads to a 3-year PGWP, as it cannot exceed 3 years.\nPermanent Residency # Requirements for permanent residency vary among provinces in Canada. For instance, Ontario requires funds for living expenses, while Quebec assesses French language proficiency.\nCanada primarily uses a points-based system where meeting specific criteria earns individuals a certain number of points, such as Canadian university degrees and local work experience. This system is akin to the points system for obtaining residency in major cities in China.\nTo obtain residency, one can apply through the Federal Skilled Worker Program Express Entry, which includes categories like FSW, FST, and CEC. Additionally, there are provincial nominee programs (PNPs) that individuals can apply through, such as Manitoba\u0026rsquo;s MPNP. Generally, an IELTS score of 8777 or proficiency in French can add points to the application.\nFurthermore, one can apply through the Provincial Nominee Program.\nIn summary, industry requirements, education, and language proficiency are three crucial factors.\nAcknowledgments # This document on healthcare, visas, residency, and education is provided by \u0026ldquo;北雁清凉\u0026rdquo; (North Goose Coolness).\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/docs/countries/Europe/Nordic/Finland/","title":"Finland","section":"Nordic","content":" Finland # Finland is a country located in Northern Europe, with Helsinki as its capital.

If additional needs arise, a referral can be requested, but the queue is longer. As a result, some transgender patients apply for referrals in GenderGP to obtain prescriptions.\nOn February 1, 2023, Finland passed the gender self-identification bill 1, which allows transgender people to change their gender without any additional steps such as diagnosis or surgery by a doctor.\nPlease refer to the kela website for reimbursement rules for various medications such as hormones.

Universities offer more master\u0026rsquo;s and doctoral programs, allowing students to obtain higher degrees such as Master\u0026rsquo;s degrees and Doctorate degrees. Universities typically offer a wide range of disciplines in areas such as theory, science, engineering, medicine, arts, and humanities. Universities of Applied Sciences\nUniversities of Applied Sciences focus on practical and vocational education, aiming to equip students with the skills and knowledge needed for practical work. Universities of Applied Sciences offer bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree programs, and they encourage students to engage in practical projects and internships during their studies. Universities of Applied Sciences prioritize collaboration with industries and practical applications to meet the demands of the job market. The importance of university rankings for undergraduate schools in Finland is not very high. Therefore, if you have decent academic achievements, you can consider applying to better universities. Additionally, the admission requirements for applied science and technology universities in Finland are relatively lenient. Although most of them require SAT/entrance exams, math ability tests, and English language scores, the specific requirements vary among different schools. You can find more information in the list of applied science and technology universities below. However, it is worth noting that the number of English majors offered at the undergraduate level is not very high in Finland, but there are usually more options at the master\u0026rsquo;s level. Both universities and applied science and technology universities in Finland generally have tuition fees that are not cheap, usually ranging from a few thousand to over ten thousand euros per year. Therefore, if you have financial constraints, you can consider choosing programs that are more likely to offer scholarships. Undergraduate scholarships often depend on academic performance.\nFinland provides a website, Study in Finland, where you can find more information about higher education in Finland. Additionally, Finland plans to increase the number of international students to three times its current amount by around 2030, which theoretically may offer more learning opportunities in the future.\nList of Universities List of Universities of Applied Sciences Universities # Finnish universities are not ranked very high globally, but they have a good learning and research atmosphere.\nDue to the relatively low international reputation of Finnish universities, many universities, especially newly established ones like Aalto University, are often overlooked. However, different universities have their strengths in various disciplines. For example, Aalto University excels in design and architecture, Tampere focuses on library and information management, Helsinki specializes in religious studies, education, agricultural sciences, and media communication, the University of the Arts Helsinki excels in performing arts, the University of Jyväskylä is known for its sports-related programs, Turku University offers nursing, and the University of Oulu specializes in communication.\nThe Finnish government and universities place great importance on research and innovation, and many universities have advanced research centers and laboratories that provide opportunities for students to engage in research projects and practical activities.\nHowever, it is important to note that many bachelor\u0026rsquo;s programs at Finnish universities are often taught in Finnish or Swedish (which may improve in the future), limiting the choices for English-taught programs. Taking Aalto University as an example, in its undergraduate program applications, only the fields of art, finance, international business, chemical engineering, computer science, data science, digital systems and design, and quantum technology offer English-taught programs. Moreover, for bachelor\u0026rsquo;s applications, many programs are structured as 3+2 bachelor\u0026rsquo;s and master\u0026rsquo;s degrees, considering changes in residence permit regulations. In theory, even as a student, one can apply for permanent residency after studying for 4 years.\nAt the same time, there are abundant scholarship options available. For undergraduate studies, scholarships are often related to GPA. For master\u0026rsquo;s studies, the focus is more on undergraduate GPA and academic achievements. Many international students receive scholarships to assist them in completing their studies.\nIn Finland, receiving a sword is a tradition upon completing a doctoral degree.\nUniversities of Applied Sciences # Universities of Applied Sciences offer many undergraduate programs, and almost every institution has some English-taught bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree programs. Common English-taught programs include IT technology, engineering, nursing, and others.\nFor more information, you can refer to Employment - Statistics Finland.\nAccommodation # Most university accommodation is not provided by the university but by institutions or companies. In the Helsingør area, common organizations include HOAS, BOTH, UniHome.\nAmong them, HOAS provides an \u0026ldquo;Other\u0026rdquo; gender option in the new Application System updated in February 2023.\nBOTH offers most rooms that are gender neutral, such as Studio.\nUniHome is similar to the above, but offers more short-term apartments.\nFees # Tuition fees in Finland range from approximately EUR 4,000 to EUR 18,000 per year. StudyInFinland also has an overview page. Different schools also have pages with information about the cost of living in their cities, such as.\n[Cost of Living and Financial Matters - University of Helsinki]( https://www.helsinki.fi/en/admissions-and-education/international-students/student-life-helsinki/cost-living- and-financial-matters) Tuition and Scholarships - Aalto University]( https://into.aalto.fi/display/enopisk/Tuition+fees+and+scholarships) Financial Matters - Aalto University *The Aalto University website is in the process of being migrated and may be subject to future changes.\nEmployment # Local employment requirements in Finland often require a good knowledge of Finnish, which makes it difficult for non-computing majors to find jobs.\nThe main career path for computer science graduates is consulting, i.e. providing solutions to other companies, which pays better. Therefore, for computer science students, certain engineering and development skills can help them to find a job better.\nData shows that the median income in Finland in 2022 is over €3,300.2\nResidency # Finland does not issue visas to students, but residence permits.\nAt the beginning of 2022, Finland renewed its residence permit policy for students, so that they can get a Class A residence permit. The visa is also granted for two years after graduation, which makes it less difficult for students to find a job after graduation.\nRegarding proof of property, Finland requires 6,720 Euros/year in the InfoFinland, which can be reduced when the school provides housing or food. The terms can be reduced when the school provides housing or food.\nClass A residence permit # A residence permit is a long-term residence permit that allows the holder to stay and work in Finland and is usually valid for a period of one to five years, which can be extended on demand.\nAfter five years, the holder can apply for a permanent residence permit.

At the same time, there is a high degree of social equality, and society is more friendly towards transgender individuals.\nTransgender Resources and Policies # Medical Resources # In the Netherlands, transgender individuals cannot decide autonomously whether to use hormones. They need to apply through the medical system. Even if they are on the waiting list, it usually takes one to two years from application to actually receiving Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) / Gender Affirming Hormone Treatment. If they were already using medication before, the probability of obtaining it can be increased, but it won\u0026rsquo;t reduce the waiting time.\nFor transgender individuals, if they are lucky enough to be assigned to a GP, the waiting time often depends on luck, and in the best-case scenario, it can be completed within a few weeks. However, if assigned to a medical center, it might take up to two years.\nRelated Resources # Regarding the change of gender markers on documents, the Netherlands has not implemented the self-id policy, meaning the process to change gender markers on documents is relatively complicated, both in terms of procedures and the time required (which might exceed one year).\nEducation # University # Top universities in the Netherlands are roughly ranked between 55-200 (2022).\nThere are mainly two types: research universities (universiteit) and universities of applied sciences (hogeschool).\nThe application process in the Netherlands is very friendly for DIY candidates, with a transparent application mechanism. Information for applications to the University of Amsterdam, VU University Amsterdam, and the University of Groningen can all be found on their official websites.\nGenerally, the admission threshold is low, except for highly selective subjects like medicine. The University of Amsterdam has one of the best communication (journalism) faculties in the world, while Leiden University has one of the most renowned law faculties in Europe. For instance, one of the most famous jurists in human history, Hugo Grotius, is an alumnus of Leiden University.\nTypical university tuition fees range from approximately 11-15k euros per year. The cost of living varies by region but is generally higher, with rents for single rooms in cities like Leiden, The Hague, and Amsterdam ranging from 950 to 1,400 euros.\nHigh School Diploma # One of the most notable features of Dutch education is the colloquium doctum system, as introduced by the University of Groningen. Hence, even if you haven\u0026rsquo;t completed your previous studies, once you turn 21, you can participate in the colloquium doctum examination. If passed, you are considered a high school graduate.\nThe colloquium doctum covers different topics, is hosted by the schools themselves, and is primarily in Dutch. Specifically, the subjects vary depending on the intended major. For example, a bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree in law requires advanced history, French or German, Dutch, and English. For the French exam, for instance, the level is equivalent to translating a mainstream traditional newspaper article (like French\u0026rsquo;s Le Monde, C1 reading, English equivalent to The Times).\nEmployment # The Netherlands offers numerous employment opportunities. Many international companies establish branches there. In addition, there are many local companies, such as Booking.com which originates from the Netherlands.\nStandardized professions like doctors and lawyers require Dutch proficiency.\nResidency # Housing policies in the Netherlands are relatively strict. Only residents with a clear housing contract can obtain a Social Security number. In smaller towns, people can often access housing provided by schools. However, in major cities like Amsterdam, housing can be scarce. Notably, even though the Netherlands offers a one-year work visa for graduates, they cannot use school housing during this period.\nYou need a valid residency for a minimum of five years, followed by a naturalization test and a Dutch proficiency test.\nIn urgent or special circumstances, if you wish to obtain residency in the Netherlands, you can truthfully state your transgender identity.

Obtaining proof is relatively easy, and even without medical proof, one can go to a hospital to receive regular HRT/GAHT treatment. There is a higher degree of tolerance for clothing styles, but aesthetic standards are still required. However, tolerance decreases significantly in the workplace. There may be middle-aged individuals who intentionally cause harm. Even hospitals not affiliated with GID organizations can issue proof, which can still be used normally. They can also provide prescriptions for psychiatric medications and introduction letters for gender confirmation surgery in Thailand. Proof obtained through diagnosis often includes bilingual labeling in Japanese and English. The fastest possible turnaround time for obtaining proof is one day, and it may be easier with proof from a Chinese hospital. However, be prepared for the requirement of 2-3 follow-up visits. If a doctor affiliated with a GID organization is needed, one can go to a large hospital, but the waiting period for an appointment is longer, typically 2-3 months and multiple diagnoses are required. However, HRT/GAHT can be obtained there, and the price is relatively cheaper. Without proof, injections can be received at Garden Hospital for 2,200 yen per shot, but after obtaining proof, one can go to other clinics. However, pre-surgery HRT/GAHT is generally not covered by insurance in Japan, so the initial costs are higher. After obtaining proof, the price ranges from 1,200 to 1,300 yen per shot, but the price may vary significantly depending on the region and hospital. In Japan, there are many unisex restrooms, and it is a personal choice to use the gender-neutral or women\u0026rsquo;s restroom. However, please try to act naturally and avoid showing fear or curiosity. Additionally, some accessible restrooms may be gender-segregated and typically placed in the women\u0026rsquo;s restroom. If it is necessary to come out and explain the situation to a teacher, it is recommended to prioritize finding Japanese teachers who appear friendly. Chinese young female teachers are the next recommended option, as Chinese male teachers generally have difficulty understanding. In terms of physical appearance, height is a concern in Japan—anything below 176 cm is generally fine. Slightly changing one\u0026rsquo;s appearance, hairstyle, and voice can also be part of the Real-Life Experience (RLE). Daily social interactions in Japan often have a sense of distance, and the language used is gender-neutral. Privacy protection in classes is also good, allowing for maintaining a gender-ambiguous status. However, it may be necessary to be cautious of some \u0026ldquo;curious\u0026rdquo; Chinese classmates/teachers. When choosing a language school, try to avoid those managed by Chinese individuals who focus on further education, as they may have strict management similar to Chinese high schools. It is preferable to choose a mostly normal school, typically with 30-40% non-Chinese Japanese students and managed by Japanese individuals. These schools are generally more international and better suited. Avoid Chinese males as much as possible. Naturalization # Permanent residence in Japan is harder than naturalization, so I\u0026rsquo;ll just talk about naturalization below. The fastest time should be five years, and after you finish studying, you can find a job and convert your student visa to a work visa.\nHowever, the language requirement for Japanese work is often not low, so it is recommended to improve Japanese as much as possible. If you are a graduate student (seminarian), the possibility of finding a job also has certain possibility, a better university can improve the probability, and computer, and information majors can also improve the probability, but it is not recommended that majors such as literature, history and philosophy bet on this probability, unless the Japanese language is very proficient.\nRemember to apply for a master\u0026rsquo;s degree to match your undergraduate degree, cross-disciplinary majors are easy to reject. Because now the Japanese industry also needs more talents.\nIn addition, if you want to study in a language school, remember not to be absent from school. If you perform well and pass the language score, both work and study will be much easier.\n"},{"id":15,"href":"/docs/universities/North-America/","title":"North America","section":"Universities","content":" North America # For North America, in the case of the United States, there is an LGBTQ College Culture Guide available here, which provides a certain level of school friendliness screening.\n"},{"id":16,"href":"/docs/preparation/","title":"Preparation","section":"Docs","content":" Preparation # To apply to a good college and go to your dream place, we need to do some prep, including but not limited to GPA, competition experience, project experience, essay publication, etc.\nThis section will describe the preparation that can be done for different majors.\nIntegration into your university # GPA # The calculation of GPA can vary greatly from school to school, so you could choose the university that scores above 90% to get the highest grade, not 100% to get the highest grade.\nContests # There are naturally different competitions for different disciplines, but there are many competitions that many engineering or application-related disciplines can participate in.\nResearch # Many labs at the university and departmental often provide a lot of resources, such as participating in professors\u0026rsquo; research projects.\n"},{"id":17,"href":"/docs/countries/","title":"Regions and Countries","section":"Docs","content":" Regions and countries # It is important for us to choose a region to study, work, and live in.

Even with a prescription, it is difficult to purchase medication through most platforms and can only be obtained by seeking legal loopholes in less-regulated areas. However, this is only a gray area, and we cannot guarantee the sustainability of this method or its cost, and in some cases, it may even violate the law. Additionally, most psychological counseling in China cannot provide adequate support and assistance for transgenders, so suitable doctors may not be found when help is needed. Furthermore, official Chinese media social accounts have repeatedly attacked transgenders 3, stigmatizing their image and inciting public emotions. To some extent, the internet violence that occurs in China based on fear and hatred towards transgender people can have a very serious impact. For example, it affects the right to study, residency, work, etc. Moreover, if you change your identity information after completing your degree at a university, the university will not re-issue your graduation certificate 4, and the online certification of a Chinese degree will not change either 4. In a sense, your qualifications may be considered invalid unless you can provide relevant documentation and modification files. However, when you submit documentation to change your information, employers will know that you are transgender and are very likely to refuse to hire you.\nDue to the lack of information from official channels such as hospitals, the trans community in China has had to establish their own information-sharing platforms.

Because we don\u0026rsquo;t have the experience to tell us which range is the one we match.\nBut other than this step, we were able to get a fair amount of work done.\nStep 1: Pick a country range # This step is more subjective, and you can combine our country and region profiles to give yourself a general range. But this range is not necessarily dead, and it may even be much broader than the range you end up choosing, and that\u0026rsquo;s all right; you can absolutely draw a little more range and thus increase the scope of your choice.\nStep 2: School List # First of all, we need to prepare some tools, such as various school rankings. Such lists are mainly used to let you know which schools you can choose, but please make sure not to be trapped by the rankings, but more importantly to be happy with your life and be able to do research in a field you relatively like. For example: QS , THE , USNews , ARWU , CWUR , etc. The rankings do not represent the actual level of the school, as different rankings have different focuses, some of which we may not care about, but this reference may also be valuable for us if we have no other sources of information. Also, note that they tend to rank every year, so you may want to be careful to switch to the latest year.\nIt is also important to note that school rankings do not represent subject rankings, and their subject rankings are also a factor to consider. It is also possible to see through some of the subject ranking agencies, which are also not very accurate, but they are free and open data and have considerable reference value.\nAmong these rankings, you can make a list of the universities in your favorite country or countries, for example. The list contains, for example, all the countries you want to filter.\nStep 3: List of programs # Then, we have to find the majors/programs that you like in these schools.\nSpecifically, we have to search for the name of the school in Google or other search engines and go to the official website. Find the admissions program or program description, and then find a list of all their undergraduate/master\u0026rsquo;s programs. This way we can use a filter or search to find the program we are interested in.\nAt this point, you use a table to record all the details of the programs you find. For example, the language requirements, GPA requirements, credit requirements, etc. for this program. In addition, often the program\u0026rsquo;s page contains information on tuition and scholarships, which is also important to consider.\nThus, once we have sorted out all the schools\u0026rsquo; available programs, you can continue to prepare according to the program requirements if you are in the pre-bachelor or high school stage; if you are about to reach the application stage, you can also start to exclude programs that do not meet the requirements.\nStep 4: Formal Application # At this point, we probably don\u0026rsquo;t have any special details to go over, as each school has different requirements, which means they may require different materials to be submitted and elaborated upon.\nGood luck with your application.\n"},{"id":23,"href":"/docs/universities/North-America/Canada/UW/","title":"University of Waterloo","section":"North America","content":" University of Waterloo # Gender Affirming Care - University of Waterloo\n"},{"id":24,"href":"/docs/preparation/computer/network-security/","title":"Network Security","section":"Computer","content":" Network Security # From the point of view of finding a job, cyber security, although you can find good working conditions and good pay, also because of the sensitivity of the industry, resulting in the actual choice is limited, after graduating from a foreign school, you may only be able to choose companies and other units.\nTherefore, although it is not recommended as a preferred major, it is perfectly acceptable to consider if you like the profession.\nCapture the Flag (CTF) # The CTF Wiki also provides good introductory and advanced content.\n"},{"id":25,"href":"/docs/countries/Asia/","title":"Asia","section":"Regions and Countries","content":" Asia # In Asia, countries that criminalize transgender expression of gender identity include Brunei, Indonesia, Lebanon, Malaysia, Myanmar, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, and the United Arab Emirates 1.\n\u0026ldquo;Transgender Travel Guide: Could You Be Breaking the Law While on Vacation?\u0026rdquo; - Hong Kong Transgender Legal Database\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"},{"id":26,"href":"/docs/universities/North-America/USA/60-120-ranking-Liberal-arts-college/","title":"Commentary on Top 60-120 Liberal Arts Colleges","section":"North America","content":" Introduction to Top 60-120 Liberal Arts Colleges # If the student population at the school has decreased in recent years (check the data), then it will be easier to apply for scholarships because they need your presence to polish their reputation.

Most students at this level of school have poor academic performance, so rigor will be correspondingly lower. Various facilities are complete. Generally, most places have unisex restrooms, and it\u0026rsquo;s okay to use the one you recognize. Other facilities are the same. Support is hard to say. Most schools have psychological counseling but don\u0026rsquo;t expect too much. Don\u0026rsquo;t expect the school to help you when you encounter injustice. For reputation\u0026rsquo;s sake, the school generally supports the aggressor. Staying in the US through work requires long-term planning.

&lt;p>In Australia, adults can proceed with informed consent to access Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) / Gender Affirming Hormone Treatment. Specifically, you can contact a local qualified doctor. Some school physicians might be eligible, but if not, they will refer you elsewhere, which might lead to some delay. The speed of obtaining hormones partly depends on the doctor&amp;rsquo;s approachability. In faster cases, medications can be prescribed within two to three weeks. Additionally, these doctors mainly prescribe hormones and antagonists, but they might not be very knowledgeable about gender confirmation surgeries, so they might not provide expert advice.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Computer Science and Technology</title><link>https://uniguide.transacademic.org/docs/preparation/computer/computer-science/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://uniguide.transacademic.org/docs/preparation/computer/computer-science/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="computer-science-and-technology">

&lt;p>Singapore is an island nation located in Southeast Asia and is known as the financial center of Asia. Singapore&amp;rsquo;s major industries include finance, aviation, technology, pharmaceuticals, and business services. Singapore is home to Chinese, Indian, Malay and other ethnic groups. The official language is English, but most people also speak Chinese, Malay or Hindi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Singapore&amp;rsquo;s level of acceptance towards the LGBTQA+ community is not considered high. It was only in mid-2022 that Singapore decriminalized male same-sex sexual activity, while reaffirming in parliament that marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman to avoid any challenges in that regard. The authorities also impose restrictions on the promotion of LGBTQA+ content, and public attitudes tend to lean towards conservatism. From certain perspectives, Singapore may appear to be legally open but still operates in a conservative manner in everyday life. &lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sweden</title><link>https://uniguide.transacademic.org/docs/countries/europe/nordic/sweden/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://uniguide.transacademic.org/docs/countries/europe/nordic/sweden/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="sweden">
